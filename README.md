# User Instructions for Simple Neural Network Prototype

# Prerequisites:
Ensure you have a .NET development environment installed, such as Visual Studio.
Basic knowledge of C# is recommended.

# Steps:
1. Load the Project:
Open the project folder containing the Neural Network prototype using your .NET development environment.
2. Configuration:
Inside the NeuralNetWork class, you can configure the size of the synapses matrix by modifying the parameters in the constructor.
3. Training Data Preparation:
Prepare your training data. The data should be structured in a matrix format where each row represents a single training example and columns are features. Also, prepare the corresponding output data.
4. Training the Neural Network:
Instantiate the NeuralNetWork class.
Use the Train method to train the neural network with your training data. Pass the training input matrix, training output matrix, and number of training iterations as parameters.
5. Making Predictions:
After training, you can make predictions by using the Think method and passing it the input data matrix.
6. Reviewing Predictions:
The predictedOutput variable will contain the neural network's predictions. You can print it or process it further as needed.
7. Running the Project:
Once you have set up the training and predictions in the code, you can run the project by pressing the "Run" or "Start" button in your development environment.
